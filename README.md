# Loop City

In Loop City, you’re a harried delivery driver working to ensure packages get delivered on time! The mail, as they say, “just keeps coming”, but if you can find the hidden wormholes, and use them to shorten your trips, you’ll be able to handle it like a pro.

This game is a 2d Crazy-Taxi-like where packages become ready to deliver, and you have to pick them up and get them to their destination before your time runs out. You get points and a time bonus once you finish a job. The game keeps looping until you run out of time!

WASD or arrow keys to drive.
